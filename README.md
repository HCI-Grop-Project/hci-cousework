Senura Furniture is a Java Swing application designed for showcasing both 2D and 3D furniture products in a virtual shop environment. It provides users with an interactive experience to explore various furniture items, visualize them in 2D and 3D, and make informed purchase decisions.

## Features

- **Virtual Showroom**: Users can browse through a virtual showroom containing a wide range of furniture items, including sofas, chairs, tables, cabinets, and more.
  
- **2D Visualization**: Each furniture item is presented with detailed 2D illustrations, allowing users to view dimensions, colors, materials, and other specifications.

- **3D Modeling**: Users can interact with 3D models of furniture items, enabling them to rotate, zoom, and inspect products from different angles to get a better understanding of their design and aesthetics.

- **Product Information**: Detailed product information is provided for each item, including descriptions, features, pricing, and availability.

- **Search and Filter**: Users can easily search for specific furniture items or filter products based on categories, styles, prices, and other criteria to find items that match their preferences.

- **Shopping Cart**: A built-in shopping cart allows users to add selected items for purchase, review their selections, and proceed to checkout.
